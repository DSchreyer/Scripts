term: asynchronous muscle
goid: BTO:0001687
definition: Asynchronous muscle is that type of muscle\nwhich, when turned on by neural input and resulting muscle action potentials, can contract in an oscillatory manner if attached to an appropriate, resonant load such as is offered in life by an insect’s wings and thorax. The frequency of the oscillatory contractions is different from, and typically much higher than, that of the activating neuronal impulses. Asynchronous muscle is so-named because during oscillation there is no direct correspondence between individual muscle\ncontractions and muscle action potentials, which contrasts with synchronous muscle in which there is a 1:1 correspondence between muscle contractions and muscle action potentials or bursts of action potentials. Asynchronous muscle is only\nknown to occur in insects. The muscles that power flight in dipteran flies, beetles, many of the true bugs and in some, but perhaps not all, bees and wasps are asynchronous muscles, as are the singing muscles of some cicadas.

definition: Primary carcinoma of the liver cells. It ranges from a well-differentiated tumour difficult to distinguish from normal hepatocytes to a poorly differentiated neoplasm. The cells may be uniform or markedly pleomorphic or may form giant cells. Several classification schemes have been suggested.

term: hypothalamus
goid: BTO:0000614
definition: A basal part of the diencephalon that lies beneath the thalamus on each side, forms the floor of the third ventricle, and includes vital autonomic regulatory centers.\nThe ventral part of the diencephalon that forms the floor and part of the lateral wall of the third ventricle. Anatomically, it includes the preoptic area, optic tract, optic chiasm, mammillary bodies, tuber cinereum, infundibulum, and neurohypophysis, but for physiological purposes the neurohypophysis is considered a distinct structure. The hypothalamus may be divided into five regions or areas (area hypothalamica rostralis, area hypothalamica dorsalis, area hypothalamica intermedia, area hypothalamica lateralis and area hypothalamica posterior) or into three longitudinal zones (periventricular zone, medial zone, and lateral zone). The hypothalamic nuclei constitute that part of the corticodiencephalic mechanism that activates, controls and integrates the peripheral autonomic mechanisms, endocrine activity, and many somatic functions, e.g., a general regulation of water balance, body temperature, sleep, and food intake, and the development of secondary sex characteristics. The hypothalamus secretes vasopressin and oxytocin, which are stored in the pituitary, as well as many releasing factors (hypophysiotropic hormones), by means of which it exerts control over functions of the adenohypophysis.

It is a type of MELANOMA and a very rare cancer, but the most common form of EYE CANCER in adults. If melanoma starts in the iris, there may be a dark spot on the iris. A symptom of melanoma in the ciliary body or choroid may be blurry vision.

term: tubercle
goid: BTO:0002173
definition: The adult male dorsal surface of Schistosoma is covered in small bosses called tubercles that provide purchase against the blood vessel wall when the worm is crawling up the mesenteric veins carrying the female in its ventral groove.  Each tubercle has a thin (2-3 micron) covering of the syncytial tegument.  Enclosed entirely within the tegument cytoplasm of the tubercle are a series of spines, made of actin, which assist in gripping the blood vessel.\nThe tegument is normally closely apposed to the underlying circular muscle layer, and separated from it only by an extracellular matrix of collagen fibres. The tubercle is the exception,\nwhere the tegument is lifted up by numerous extensions of\nparenchymal cells. The parenchymal cell bodies lie below the muscle layers and send out narrow extensions of cytoplasm which insinuate between the muscles to form the packing for the tubercle.
